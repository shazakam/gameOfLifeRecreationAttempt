# gameOfLifeRecreationAttempt
This is my attempt at creating my own version of the Game of Life.
The program works as follows when run:
A grid appears on which the player may click on tiles to colour them blue
Alongside the grid, a start button also appears which when pressed goes through one iteration of the game.
The player may then choose to either continue pressing start to see where the iteration goes or to add more blocks.

Although the program functions as desired ther are a few outstanding problems as of now:
The edge of the array is not taken into account if blocks are coloured along it.
Code needs to be commented more for legibility

Proposed new elements:
Instead of a start button the user can input how many iterations they wish for the program to run through when start is pressed.
Have the blocks be randomly coloured (anything except white).
Light up to a specific colour if a set of blocks enters a "stable state" (a state which on its own never dies).
